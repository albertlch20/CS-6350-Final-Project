# CS-6350-Final-Project

## Note
Copy and paste the code in model.py to databricks to run

## Progress

### Preprocessing
1. Read dataset to dataframe
2. Transfrom weather to label (rain, drizzle, snow = 1, others = 0)
3. Split training/testing set (1200/461) (may consider adding val set later)

### Model
1. Add a 2-layer model from https://www.kaggle.com/code/wwsalmon/simple-mnist-nn-from-scratch-numpy-no-tf-keras/notebook, need to change it to RNN later.
2. Add a simple RNN model
3. Add more functions for experiments
4. Experiments done
