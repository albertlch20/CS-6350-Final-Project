Authors: Chih-Hen Lee, Zhifang Deng, Kwonyoung Lee, Jessica Nguyen

Description: 
This project uses the dataset "Weather Prediction" by Ananth R from Kaggle. The goal of the project is to use Recurrent Neural Networks to predict whether the weather will be good or bad using the following features: percent precipitation, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and wind speed. The performance of the model will be determined by precision, recall, accuracy, and F1-score. 

Installation Instructions: 
1. Download model.py file 
2. Copy and paste the code in model.py to Databricks to run

Alternate Installation: 
1. Import notebook from the Databricks link and run:
